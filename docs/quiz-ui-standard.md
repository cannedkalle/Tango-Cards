# Quiz UI standard

Two separate sets: a mobile set and a desktop set. The mobile set is
formalized below and governs phone widths. The desktop set is not yet
formalized; its section at the end records current behavior only.

The five quiz games — Balls in the Ballpark, Before the Bulb, Name Quest,
Animal Outsider, Twin Terms — share one frame and one set of play modes.
Tango Cards (collecting) and Marble Battles (a simulation) are not
quizzes: they live in their own home section and keep their own controls.
The sets below govern the five quizzes.

## Mobile UI standard

The shell (`app/components/QuizShell.jsx`) is the single controller for
game chrome on phones. Games own their question content, choice layout,
and reveal panels — everything else below is uniform, with no per-game
exceptions.

### Frame, top to bottom

With the settings menu collapsed, the whole quiz — question plus all
choices — is visible without scrolling on a 390×844 phone. That is the
fit rule, and it outranks any single element's size: if a game's content
cannot fit under it, the content shrinks (see the open decision on Bulb
art below); the frame does not grow.

1. **Row 1: PortalNav.** Site title + icon on the left, Back to all
   apps on the right, one row. The row is flush with the game below:
   no side margins stack on the page padding. Bottom padding 12px plus
   border.
2. **Row 2: GameBar.** Game name + Start over + one options dropdown,
   in a single row. Every setting a game has (play mode, difficulty,
   content pool) lives in the dropdown, closed by default, with the
   current choices summarized on the toggle (e.g. "Curated · Endless").
   Picking a setting collapses the menu again and resets the score,
   exactly as a visible control row did. No kicker, no tagline, no
   separate picker rows.
3. **Status line.** One small plain-text line, never a box or a pill:
   "Round N · X right · Y played · streak Z", plus lives hearts and
   the word "lives" in 3-lives mode. 12px, muted, semibold,
   margin-bottom 10px. Every quiz game tracks a streak (consecutive
   correct rounds); a wrong answer or give-up resets it. Rounds are
   always numbered "Round N" ("Round N of 10" in 10-question mode),
   and the line shows the round being played, including during the
   reveal.
4. **Question line.** One row: the question itself, left-aligned
   ("Which came first?", "Which one is the outsider?", Twin's prompt).
   No flavor eyebrow, no instruction paragraph; the choices carry the
   meaning. (Bulb's centered question becomes left-aligned when it
   adopts the frame.)
5. **Choices.** Game-owned layout, under the fit rule. Choice controls
   are at least 44px tall; the game bar's 36px controls are the one
   deliberate exception, bought for the one-row bar.
6. **Reveal.** Below the choices after answering; it scrolls, and the
   fit rule does not apply to it. Its Next button reads "Next round";
   when the game is over it reads "See results" instead.
7. **Results screen.** Kicker "10 rounds done!" (10-question mode) or
   "Out of lives!" (lives mode), score summary, Play again (primary).

### Row 2 sizes (≤600px)

- Game name: 18px, weight 800.
- Start over: icon only, 36px button, aria-label "Start over".
- Dropdown toggle: 12px, weight 700, padding 6px 8px.
- Gaps: 6px. Bar margin-bottom: 8px.
- The row fits one row at 390px width, and at 375px with the 16px page
  padding below. At 601–760px the full row-2 layout applies (text Start
  over, 13px toggle), since width allows it.

### Page padding (phones, ≤600px)

Shell pages: 16px sides, 16px top, uniformly. No per-game padding.

### Row 1 flushness (≤760px)

Row 1's flush rule applies at ≤760px, the widest width where the old
nav margin appears. Above that, the desktop set will decide.

### Play modes (`lib/quiz-play.mjs`, same rules in both sets)

- **Endless** (default): play forever, the way these games always worked.
  No end screen.
- **10 questions**: exactly 10 answered rounds, then the results screen.
- **3 lives**: a wrong answer loses one of three lives; 0 lives ends the
  game with the results screen. A right answer never costs a life. In
  Name Quest a close answer counts as scored, so it costs no life.

Switching mode — or difficulty, where a game has one — always resets the
score, so one mode's results never mix with another's. Games keep their
own round engines; they share the pure rules in `lib/quiz-play.mjs`
(`nextLives`, `isGameOver`, `livesHeartStates`), covered by
`tests/quiz-play.test.mjs`. In Balls in the Ballpark, the no-repeat window
behind a fresh game lives for the whole page session, so Play again never
re-deals a recent matchup, while every deal stays an independent random
draw — no deck, no fixed sequence.

### Shared chrome (both sets)

The same control looks the same in every game. Game content keeps its own
accent (Bulb peach/blue, Animal leaf, Name Quest violet); only the chrome
is uniform.

- **Game title**: `.qs-bar-title` in the shell game bar (24px desktop,
  18px on phones).
- **Primary action**: `.pf-primary` (Next, Play again, See results).
- **Secondary button**: `.pf-btn` (Start over, Restart, difficulty
  choices, panel controls). Pressed rectangular buttons show the shared
  pressed checkmark; pills never do.
- **Mode picker**: `.pf-pill-group` + `.pf-pill`, text only. The green
  pill is the selection. Content mode, then play mode.
- **Icons**: one SVG set in `Icons.jsx` — back, restart, forward, lives
  hearts — used only where the icon carries meaning, and the same icon
  everywhere it appears. Pickers show text only; game content keeps its
  own decorative marks (Bulb's sparkles, Wild-guess winner marks).
- **Radii**: 12px small, 16px control, 24px card. Circles (50%) and
  progress bars keep their own shapes.

### Home sections (`lib/apps.js`)

Each app carries a `section` field. The home page renders Quiz games
first — Balls in the Ballpark, Name Quest, Animal Outsider, Before the
Bulb, Twin Terms — then Non-quiz games — Tango Cards, Marble Battles.

### Open decisions (mobile)

- Bulb's stacked 16/10 card art fits the fit rule at 844px and taller
  (including a Pro Max) but not at 667–740px. Options: cap mobile art
  height (around 150px, still cropped) or accept scrolling on smaller
  phones. Decision open; the card design is unchanged until it is made.
- Name Quest's side score panel and level row are removed when it
  adopts the frame; its mode question becomes the prompt line, and its
  Items count and progress bar go.

### Adoption (mobile)

Twin Terms and Before the Bulb adopted the frame first. Animal Outsider,
Balls in the Ballpark, and Name Quest adopt it in turn, keeping their
own content and accents.

## Desktop UI standard

Not yet formalized. Current behavior, recorded not blessed: the same
shell structure at desktop sizes (24px bar title, text Start over,
13px toggle, 13px status, 24–32px page padding); row 1 currently
centered at 1176px via globals.css. Formalize after mobile.

## Exceptions (not quizzes)

- Marble Battles keeps Restart in its controls and has no play modes;
  it is a simulation, not a quiz.
- Tango Cards has no rounds, so no Start over and no play modes.
